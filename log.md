# Day 1
I spend the day figuring out the problem and approach to take for the problem .Also, made some changes in text renderer taken from https://github.com/oh-my-ocr/text_renderer.git
1. Changed cn.txt in [text_renderer-master/example_data/char](text_renderer-master/example_data/char)
2. Edited chn_text.txt and enum_text.txt files 

The reason for above was to reduce the time of working that is instead of editing whole code for english and remove chinese text , I replaced all chinese text file content to english.

# Day 2
Figured out how to create TFRecord still has some work left to do. 
Uploaded the notebook in whcih various operations are being held
